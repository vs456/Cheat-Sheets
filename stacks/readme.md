# Stacks

## Operations:

* Create Stack
    This creates a new stack, in python it can be created using:
    * [A python list without size limit](stack_list_unlimited.py)
    * [A python list with size limit](stack_list_limited.py)
    * [A linked list](stack_linked_list.py)
* Push
    This will add a new element into the stack
* Pop
    This will delete the most recently added element. Stack is always LIFO(Last In First Out)
* Peek
    This will return the latest element added.
* isEmpty
    Checks if there is atleast an element in the stack.
* isFull
    Checks if the stack is full, in case the stack is defined using arrays. In case of python lists, the size is unlimited.
* Delete Stack
    Deletes the entire stack.
